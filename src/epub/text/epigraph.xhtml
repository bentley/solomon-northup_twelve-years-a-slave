					<span>“Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reverence what is ancient, and can plead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A course of long observance for its use,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That even servitude, the worst of ills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because delivered down from sire to son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But is it fit, or can it bear the shock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of rational discussion, that a man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compounded and made up, like other men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of elements tumultuous, in whom lust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And folly in as ample measure meet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the bosom of the slave he rules,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should be a despot absolute, and boast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Himself the only freeman of his land?”</span>
